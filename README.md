[myAvatar™](https://www.ntst.com/Solutions-and-Services/Offerings/myAvatar) is a behavioral health EHR, developed by [Netsmart](https://www.ntst.com/), that offers a recovery-focused suite of solutions that leverage real-time analytics and clinical decision support to drive value-based care.

But while myAvatar™ is a robust platform, like most things in life (except [Heroes of Might and Magic III](https://www.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition)), it isn't perfect.

The good news is that myAvatar™ functionality can be extended via Netsmart's myAvatar™ Web Services, and/or custom web services that are written by myAvatar™ users.

The Avatool Web Service is one such custom web service which includes various tools and utilities for myAvatar™ that aren't included in the official release, and provides a solid foundation for building additional functionality quickly and efficiently.

# FEATURES
* Several built-in tools and utilities for use with myAvatar™
* A solid foundation to build additional custom tools and utilities

# REQUIREMENTS
* A location to host the Avatool Web Service
* Access to your myAvatar™ environments from the Avatool Web Service via HTTPS

# BEFORE YOU BEGIN
There are a few things you should know before using the Avatool Web Service in your myAvatar environments.

First, some components of the Avatool Web Service will need to be customized before they can be used at your organization. These components, and the customization that they require, are detailed various documents in this repository. You'll know what needs to be changed, and what it needs to be changed to, as long as you follow the instructions.

You'll also need a location to host the Avatool Web Service. In our environment, the Avatool Web Service resides on a Microsoft Windows Server 2019 with IIS. I took some [notes on setting up IIS for the Avatool Web Service](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Avatool-Web-Service/blob/master/doc/Setting-Up-IIS-10) (YMMV!), if you decide to go that route.

You can also have Netsmart host your custom web services (for a fee), but the Avatool Web Service has not been tested in a hosted environment.

### SCRIPTLINK
When working with custom web services and myAvatar™, it's inevitable that you will hear about ScriptLink. And depending on who/what is describing what ScriptLink is/does, you are going to get different answers.

Netsmart tends to use "ScriptLink" as another way to say "custom web services", but that's not really the case. I mean, a "custom web service" is just that - a web service. ScriptLink isn't a web service. 

As far as I can tell, ScriptLink is simply a *link* to a *script*. Or, more specifically, a *link* to a *custom web service*. Or, even more specifically, *something that calls a method in a custom web service when something is done with/on a form in myAvatar™*.

In my experience, ScriptLink is essentially a line of code in the form designer that kicks off the magical stuff you've written in a custom web service.

# GETTING STARTED
Before we continue, please verify you have met the [requirements](#requirements).

### PRE-REQUISITES
If you are self-hosting the Avatool Web Service, you will need a web server that:
* Can serve data via HTTPS
* Includes the .NET 4.6 framework

# INSTALLATION
The Avatool Web Service isn't *installed* so much as it is *published*.

The current method of publishing the web service is to just copy the entire project to where it is being hosted. Future versions of the Avatool Web Service will utilize the publishing functionality of Visual Studio.

# USAGE
There are a variety of ways to use custom web services with myAvatar, the most common being:
* when a form loads ("Form Load")
* after the submit button is clicked, but prior to filing the form ("Pre-File")
* after the submit button is clicked and the form has been filed ("Post-File")

You can also use custom web services with fields and controls, but that is beyond the scope of this documentation.

If you would rather start with a completely blank Web Service project for Visual Studio, you can follow the instructions for [creating the Avatool Web Service](https://github.com/APrettyCoolProgram/Avatool-Web-Service/blob/master/doc/Creating%20the%20Avatool%20Web%20Service.md). This will give you an empty Web Service that can be used with myAvatar.
