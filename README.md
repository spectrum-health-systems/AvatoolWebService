# ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY
This is a template for GitHub repositories. Just clone this project, add your files, customize some things, and there you go!

One of the first things you should do is to modify this file, README.md. Your repository README is the first thing users will see. It's your one shot to make a good first impression and convince the reader they should learn more about your repository. But where do you start? What makes a good README file?

This is a README.md template written in GitHub-flavored Markdown and HTML. A simple text editor (even GitHub itself) is all you need. The README source code contains an abundance of comments that walk you through each of the components. Customize those you want to use and remove those you don't need.

<!-- FEATURES [Optional] ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# BEFORE YOU BEGIN
A GitHub README.md file can be written in GitHub-flavored Markdown, HTML, or a mix of both. Each of these formats have their advantages and disadvantages, and a well-written README will leverage the strength of each. In order to use this template, you'll need to understand at least the basics of both.

#### What is markdown?
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Markdown's key design goal is *readability*. This readme uses GitHub-flavored Markdown, for the README *content*.

#### What is HTML?
[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. Keep in mind that GitHub README.md files do not fully support HTML syntax - a small subset of HTML tags are allowed. In addition, most HTML structures are either unnecessary (thanks to Markdown), or unsupported. For the most part, this template uses HTML to modify the *layout* of your README, such as complex tables or content positioning

### ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
While designing these templates, I read, researched, and borrowed ideas from existing README resources, and this project would not have been possible without them. Please see the [acknowledgements](documentation/acknowledgements.md) and document for more information. 

### ADDITIONAL READING
For more Markdown resources, please see the [additional reading](documentation/additional-reading.md) document.

  decided to use the project (i.e. a copy of this template file).
