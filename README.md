The Avatool Web Service includes various tools and utilities for Netsmart's myAvatar EHR that aren't built into the official release, as provides a solid foundation for building custom functionality quickly and efficiently.

# FEATURES
* Several tools and utilities for use with myAvatar
* A solid foundation to build custom tools and utilities

# REQUIREMENTS
* A location to host the Avatool Web Service via HTTPS
* Access to your myAvatar LIVE environment from the Avatool Web Service
* Familiarity with the C# programming language

# BEFORE YOU BEGIN
There are a few things you should know before using the Avatool Web Service in your myAvatar environments.

First, some components will need to be customized before they can be used at your organization.

You'll also need a location to host the Avatool Web Service. You can pay Netsmart to host your custom Web Services (easier?), or use a web server of your choice (harder?). In our environment, the Avatool Web Service resides on a Microsoft Windows Server 2019 with IIS. I took [notes on setting up IIS for the Avatool Web Service](https://github.com/APrettyCoolProgram/Avatool-Web-Service/blob/master/doc/Notes%20on%20setting%20up%20IIS%20for%20the%20Avatool%20Web%20Service.pdf), if you decide to go that route.

If you would rather start with a completely blank Web Service project for Visual Studio, you can follow the instructions for [creating the Avatool Web Service](https://github.com/APrettyCoolProgram/Avatool-Web-Service/blob/master/doc/Creating%20the%20Avatool%20Web%20Service.md). This will give you an empty Web Service that can be used with myAvatar.

# GETTING STARTED

### PRE-REQUISITES
