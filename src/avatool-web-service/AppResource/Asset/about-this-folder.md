### AppResource/Asset/*
> This file is a placeholder to ensure that the ***AppResource/Asset/**** folders are included in the GitHub repository, and are also
created (if they don't exist already) at runtime.

#### Purpose
All project assets belong here.

A project resource is static data that an application needs to function.

Examples of project resources are:
* An image for a button control
* A sound effect when a button is pushed
* A non-standard font

#### Structure
Each of the following locations may have its own folder structure.

| Folder                     | Contents        |
|---------------------------:|:----------------|
| `AppResource/Asset/Audio/` | Project audio   |
| `AppResource/Asset/Font/`  | Project fonts   |
| `AppResource/Asset/Image/` | Project images  |
