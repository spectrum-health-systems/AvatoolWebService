             *    the system date, a pop-up will notify the user that they need to modify the Pre-Admission Date field
             *    to equal the system time, and the user will be returned to the form to modify the Pre-Admission Date.
             *
             *  - If the "Admission Type" is not set to "Pre-Admission", or if it is and the Pre-Admission Date is the
             *    same as the system date, the form is submitted normally.
