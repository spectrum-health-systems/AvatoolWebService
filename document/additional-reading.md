John Gruber, the creator of Markdown, has written [Markdown Basics](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics), and [Markdown Syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

Adam Pritchard has a nice [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
